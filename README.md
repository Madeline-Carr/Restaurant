# Cosimo's Italian Restaurant

## What is this?

This website is a test of my design and web development skills. The goal is to understand my work flow better and to see what problems might arise when I am working based on a specific design.

## Tools & Technology

I started of by using my starter kit which can be found in my projects. I used react and sass for the design. This was very helpful because there are repeated elements on the diffrent pages. I am using github pages to host this website.

## Design

I used Adobe XD and Illustrator to design this website. The goal was to have a photo oriented design. The hero image on the home page is an example of the photo working with the text as a design element and not just placed into the code. The photos came from pixabay.com and pexels.com.
