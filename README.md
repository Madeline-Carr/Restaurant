# My-Starter-Kit

## Why did I create this?

I wanted to learn how to use gulp, webpack, and babel in more detail. This project was extremely helpful. There were a lot of things I could do by reading documentation but there were some other problems that required more resources. I had some interesting difficulties when I was using tutorials that were outdated or when I wanted to do something in a new way. It was a lot of fun finding new ways and solutions to solve these unique problems. I especially like the file setup that I am using for react and sass because it is very quick and easy to use.

## How to use?

To use this kit you need node, npm, and gulp installed.

Once you open the project type `npm install` or `npm i` to install node_modules.

After you have the node_modules run `gulp` to start the features.

There are basic files for react and sass that are already made. You can delete them and make your own. They need to stay in the same folder or a child folder for all the features to work.

## What Features are Included?

-   SASS Compiler
-   CSS Auto Prefixer
-   CSS Minify
-   React
-   Automatic Reload
